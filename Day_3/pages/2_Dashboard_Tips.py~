The dataset includes features such as the total bill, tip amount, day of the week, time of day, and other customer information. The tips dataset is often used to explore relationship between tips and other factors such as the day of the week or time of day. The dataset has also been used to develop and evaluate machine learning models for predicting tip amounts based on customers.")
